# HealthDatafromWearables
Assigment for Data Science for Health course of the UB Master. Predicing patient's activities based on wearable's information.
Daily Sports and Activities dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was used. This dataset contains motion sensor data of 19 daily and sports activities (walking, running, rowing, jumping,...), each performed by 8 subjects in their own style for 5 minutes. Five Xsens MTx units are used on the torso, (right and left) arms, and (right and left) legs.
The goal was successfully reading these files an combining them into a single dataframe, and later on training a model on every user and predict activity for every user, and training it on a subset of a patient's data and predict the the activities for all the remaining patients.

Objectives
1.Understand time-series health data
2.Perform pre-processing and visualisation on time-series data
3.Extract features from time-series data
4.Train a classifier to predict the activity the users are doing
